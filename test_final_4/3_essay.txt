Like, I use my computer to do my homework and look up facts for projects. It’s faster than using books. And it’s fun to play games on it after school.

Computers also let me talk to my cousins who live far away. We use this thing called Skype to see each other on the screen. It’s like they’re right there in my room. I can also send messages and share photos on Facebook. It’s cool!

Another good thing is, computers help with jobs. My dad looks for jobs online and fills out applications. It saves him time from driving everywhere. You can even pay bills and shop without leaving home. That’s pretty neat.

So, I believe computers are good. They help with learning, connecting with people, and doing important things. People should use them.

I think computers have good effects on people. Three reasons are they teach skills, help with school, and connect friends.

First, computers teach skills like typing and mouse moving. This is good for jobs later. I learned to type fast on my computer. Also, playing games helps with hand-eye stuff.

Second, computers help with schoolwork. I use the computer to find info for projects. It’s faster than books and has more. Like when I needed facts about Mars, boom, there they were!

Third, computers let you chat with friends. We use it to plan hangouts and share jokes. Even if pals move away, we still talk. It’s like they’re still here.

So, computers are good. They teach skills, help with school, and keep friends close. We should use them wisely and not too much.

That's why I think computers are cool and useful.

Dear Local Newspaper,

I think computers are really good for people. They help us learn stuff and talk to friends. One big reason is hand-eye coordination. When you use a mouse or keyboard, it helps your brain and hands work together. Like, when I play games on the computer, I get better at moving the mouse fast.

Another reason is finding information. If you need to know something, you can just type it into Google and boom! There it is. It's way faster than looking in books. Last month, I needed info for my science project and the computer helped me find it quick.

Also, computers help us chat with friends. Even if they're far away, we can still message each other. It's like having a pen pal, but better because it's instant.

That's why I think computers have a good effect on people. They help us learn, find stuff, and stay connected.

Dear Local Newspaper,

I think computers have a positive effect on people. They help us learn new stuff and do lots of things. Like, if you need to find out info for a school project, you can just type it in and boom, there it is! And you can chat with friends online and share stuff like music and pics. It’s like having a big library in your house but with games and music too. Also, you can find jobs and apply for them online, so you don’t have to go to the store or anything. That’s why I think computers are good and help people a lot. They’re like magic boxes that do so much!
